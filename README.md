# ICML2025: Let LLM Tell What to Prune and How Much to Prune

> We have uploaded the pruned model to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w-seUB0iq7Ft0reIjQqBpKJzGTYeJIDP), and it can be directly accessed using `eval_prune_llm.py`.


## Usage

```bash
python eval_prune_llm.py
```

## Note
```
As the original hardware environment was no longer available, we reran the pruning experiments on a new hardware platform.
In addition, the choice of random seed has an impact on the final results.
As a result, the performance of the pruned LLMs provided here shows slight differences from that reported in the original paper.
Overall, it remains comparable and even performs better on certain datasets.
